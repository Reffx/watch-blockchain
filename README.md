# Customer Loyalty Program with blockchain

A customer loyalty program allows companies to reward customers who frequently make purchases. Program members are able to earn points on purchases, which can translate into some type of reward such as discount, freebie or special customer treatment. The members work toward a certain amount of points to redeem their reward. These programs can have multiple companies as partners on the program, to cater to a customer base. However, current loyalty program systems are restraint on relations between partners, and with visibility to members. These restraints can be removed by creating the customer loyalty program on a blockchain network.

This blockchain model for a customer loyalty program enhances the value of points to loyalty program members and brings in new value to the partners by creating trusted transactions. Participants in this network have a more level relation among each other and points are in the centric position to connect all participants.

In this code pattern, we will create a customer loyalty program as a blockchain web application using Hyperledger Fabric and Node.js. The application will allow members to register on the network where they will create their account. They will be identified on the network with their account number and will create an access key which they will use to sign in. This access key is used as the card id for the member to make transactions and query records. The member once signed in, can make transactions to earn points and redeem points from the partners on the network. They can view their transactions as part of the blockchain ledger. This code pattern illustrates the use of permissions as part of the network where a member can only view their transactions.

Similarly for the partner, they will register by creating an identity on the network and an access key which will be used to view their records. Partners are allowed to view only transactions they were part of, and thus can keep track of all their transactions where they allocated or redeemed points. The web application shows a basic dashboard for the partner displaying the total points that they have allocated and redeemed to members. As transactions get complex, the partner can perform analysis on their transactions to create informative dashboards.

This code pattern is for developers looking to start building blockchain applications with Hyperledger Fabric and IBM Blockchain extension for VSCode. When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

* Setup a Hyperledger Fabric network on IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VSCode.
* Install and instantiate a smart contract through the IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VSCode on a local fabric connection.
* Develop a Node.js web application with the Hyperledger Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network


## Architecture Flow

</p>

**Note** The blockchain network will have multiple members and partners

1. Member is registered on the network
2. Member can sign-in to make transactions to earn points, redeem points and view their transactions
3. Partner is registered on the network
4. Partner can sign-in to view their transactions and display dashboard

</p>


#### 3. Setup network locally and deploy the smart contract

You should see `FABRIC ENVIRONMENTS` on the left side of the editor. Under this section, you should see `Local Fabric`. Click it to start the Local Fabric.

<p align="center">
  <img height="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/72647777-5208ef80-3947-11ea-89f3-1aedc042f7b7.png">
</p>

The extension will now provision the Docker containers that will act as nodes in your network. Once the provisioning is finished and the network is up and running, you will see the options to install and instantiate the smart contract, the `Channels` information, the `Nodes` and the organization msps under `Organizations`. You are now ready to install the smart contract.

<p align="center">
  <img height="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/72297496-0ba35000-362a-11ea-9f37-e5819b0dd751.png">
</p>


* In the `FABRIC ENVIRONMENTS` section near the bottom, click on `Smart Contracts` > `Installed` > `+ Install`.  You will see a pop-up similar to the graphic below. 

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/72647002-75329f80-3945-11ea-910d-ba0d03582e20.png">
</p>

* Then select the packaged contract: `customerloyalty@0.0.1 Packaged`  **Note** The 0.0.1 comes from your `package.json` line:  `"version": "0.0.1"`

After the install is complete, you should get a message `Successfully installed on peer peer0.org1.example.com`.  You should also see that the contract is listed under `Installed` under `FABRIC ENVIRONMENTS`.

<p align="center">
  <img width="300" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/72647027-87acd900-3945-11ea-9b9c-b08b4df7e0db.png">
</p>


* Under **Smart Contracts** you will see a section that says **Instantiated**. Click on `+ Instantiate` under it.

* The extension will then ask you which contract and version to instantiate — choose `customerloyalty@0.0.1 Installed`.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/72647057-998e7c00-3945-11ea-8c2a-efa9a81320ff.png">
</p>

* The extension will then ask you which function to call on instantiate — type in `instantiate`

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" width="300" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/72641008-149c6600-3937-11ea-9598-43004c3d8b76.png">
</p>

* Next, it will ask you for the arguments to the function. There are none, so just hit enter.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/72641072-43b2d780-3937-11ea-8cbc-ab4e757367d1.png">
</p>

* Next, the extension will then ask you do you want to use a provide a private data collection configuration file? - Click on `No`.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/72641080-4a414f00-3937-11ea-8f2b-37b85090fd6c.png">
</p>

* Lastly, the extension will then ask you do you want to choose a smart contract endorsement policy. Choose `Default (single endorser, any org)`.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/72641101-53322080-3937-11ea-89f8-4db2f23a8b27.png">
</p>

Once instantiation of the contract completes, you should get the message `Successfully instantiated smart contract` and you should see `customerloyalty@0.0.1` under `Instantiated` under `FABRIC ENVIRONMENTS`.

<p align="center">
  <img width="300" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/72648095-1d496800-3948-11ea-9619-d2c5eab47a02.png">
